### Purchasing
- Use JLCPCB for purchasing the PCBs
- Use JLCPCB with the 8001 Transparent Resin for the 3D printed joystick parts
- Keycaps can be [3D printed](https://github.com/rana-sylvatica/circle-keycaps) or be [purchased](https://ko-fi.com/s/02dc1dde96)
### Joystick Modification
- Refer to steps 2 and 3 from https://github.com/Sharp-02/JLF-Sharp-Analog-Snap-In#step-2--restrictor-gate-and-trimming
- Take the original joystick motherboard and desolder all 4 switches
- Open up each of the swithes
- Remove the metal support on the left side of each switch
- trim the switch housing up to the point where the mechanical pieces begin on the left side (when the red piece is facing you)
- Remove the red piece
- Put the trimmed cover back on the trimmed switch
- Glue each of the switches back into its original location and solder the one metal support back into the pcb
- To properly attach the magnets place them in the slider arms so that when they are held by the linear guide they are on the same side
- Take the joystick motherboard and place the hall effect sensors in the labeled ports so that the smaller face of the sensor is pointing away from the center of the board
- Solder in the hall effect sensors and trim the excess sensor legs and solder on the bottom of the pcb
- Connect wires into each of available spots on the edge of the board
- Connect the wires to the corresponding spots on the left side of the ThudStick v2 motherboard
- Put the joystick pcb in its 3d printed holder
- Place the slider arms in the linear guide so that the magnets move in front of the hall effect sensors when the linear guide is screwed in
- Use 20mm m3 screws and bolts to affix the linear guide to the pcb
- Connect this 3d assembly back into the joystick making sure the hall effect sensor that is connected to the X data ports on the motherboard is on the bottom or top
### PCB
- Flash the v0.29 PHOB software to the motherboard
- Place the lower half of the button housing on all of the keyswitches
- Solder each keyswitch into the motherboard
### Final Assembly
- Use 4 standoffs, 20mm M5 screws, and nuts to affix the motherboard to the aluminum faceplate
- Place the aluminum faceplate on the case
- Use 4 50 mm M5 screws and 4 M5 t-nut fittings to connect the aluminum faceplate to the case
- Screw on the top housing for each of the buttons and put keycap on each
